Dumbest thing I've ever written. Constructing some new phrases from an existing ones. I don't know what I'm spending my life for.

### build
Install stack, clone this repository, then go to the directory of cloned repository and type following commands.
```haskell
$ stack build
$ stack install

```bash 
$ ./salad /some/file.txt
```

### example
```
$ ./salad ./res/somedata.txt
If we abstract from sich' itself], one Hegel's standard sich.' itself]....A child, Hegel's is
